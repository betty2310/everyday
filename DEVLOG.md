# 03.17.2022 - Đây hẳn là tag nhỉ/Còn đây là title.

## Mình đã build được 1 trang web.

Sau đây là phần test mark down, xem nó có thể hiển thị những nội dung gì!

### Heading 3, 1 với 2 thì hiển thị bên trên rồi :v.

* list 1
* list 2

1. Number 1
2. Number 2

1. Number 1
    * List 1
    * List 2
2. Number 2

### Một block code nào!!!

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!";
    return 0;
}
```

### Test link với image nhỉ, ví dụ: [My github](https://github.com/betty2310)

Đây là [dotfiles](https://github.com/betty2310/dotfiles) của mình. Hiện mình đang dùng chính là hệ điều hành Linux, nên việc backup chủ yếu dựa trên các file `.` này. Lại còn sử dụng `Window manager` chứ không dùng `DE` nữa chứ. Nhân tiện, `wm` mình đang dùng hiện tại là [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) 

Đây là 1 chiếc image của mình.
![image](https://github.com/betty2310/file/blob/main/awesome/out.png?raw=true)
Vậy còn `gif` thì sao?
![image](https://github.com/betty2310/file/blob/main/awesome/output.gif?raw=true)
**Yeah, everything fine** *mình quên mất là phải test in nghiêng* **đậm** hay là ~~strike~~ đấy.

### Còn j nữa nhỉ?

> 1 đoạn quote đi. Khi nào bạn cần may áo giáp sắt nên sang phố Huế hỏi..... :v. 
> 
> *chữ nghiêng* hay **in đậm** cũng được nhớ

| 1 cái    | bảng   | có        | 4 cột |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | ----- |
| Nội dung | Ở hàng | Thứ       | Nhất  |
| Còn đây  | Thì ở  | hàng thức | Hai   |
| Thôi vậy | Thôi   | Nhể       | :v      |

Hay là thử 1 tý nâng cao kiểu `math render` nhể. Nhưng mình nghĩ là không được đâu. Ví dụ như là `inline math` này: 
$ \int_{0}^{1} f(x)\mathrm{d}x $

Nhưng còn thế này thì seo:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{100} (i+1)
$$

# 03.17.2022 - Test/Test Markdown in my website :v

This is an example note.
You can write notes in [GitHub-flavored Markdown](http://doc.inkdrop.info/manual/markdown-cheatsheet).
Thử một số dòng gõ tiếng việt xem nó render có tốt không, có vẻ là không có lỗi gì hết nhỉ,

## H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   * Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
  日本語では簡単ですが、面白いです。

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)


* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
| Why alway me  | are neat      |    $1 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Horizontal Rule

Three or more...

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

Underscores

## Line Breaks

Iosevka font is so gogerious, like :v

# 03.15.2022 - Reading Notes/How to Edit Your Own Writing

**Article:** https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-edit-your-own-writing.html

## Why editing?

Writing is like thinking. You will not know precisely what you are going to say before you say it. And many people make mistakes by saying something they're not supposed to say or getting a hard time explaining what they want to talk about.

On the other hand, writing offers us a rare chance in life: Do over. We can take a lot of time to get everything right before saying it aloud.

So keep in mind that what you write first is always a draft. You will need to edit and rewrite each line in the article multiple times before it becomes a good article.

## How to edit?

It's recommended to read ["The Elements of Style"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White for a how-to guide on writing good, clear English and avoiding most common mistakes.

For most of the cases, pay attention to these mistakes:

- **Overuse of jargon** (or use without a clear explanation): try to find alternative and shorter words to make the article more readable to the expected audience.
- **Use passive voice:** passive voice makes it sounds distant and lacks authority. For example, *"This article was written by Harry"* will not make it a strong statement as *"Harry wrote this article"*.
- **Rambling:** saying too much unnecessary stuff and not getting to the point, usually found when you are unsure about what you are going to say.

Some good tips when editing an article:

- **Give it some time before editing:** you need to step away from your work before going to the editing phase. Somewhere between 30 minutes to two days is a good enough break.
- **Kill your darling:** OK, this is a catchy statement. It's a quote from Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch: "In writing, you must kill all your darlings". What it means is, don't hesitate to cut unnecessary words, sentences, phrases from your article, make it shorter. It will tighten the work and make everything more straightforward.
- **Spend the most time on the beginning:** the first few sentences and paragraphs are the most important part of catching your audience's attention. Briefly lay out all the points in your writing from the beginning, then you can go deeper in later parts.
- **Pay attention to the structure:** a good structure will help the audience read better. And it's normal if your structure change between drafts. It's a sign that you are developing the article as a whole, not just fixing some minor problems.
- **Use some help:** when writing on a computer, use grammar helper software. It can catch some common writing mistakes and offer suitable alternatives. Also, ask a friend or relative to look at your work with a fresh mind. They might spot something you missed.

# 03.14.2022 - Elm/Building large Elm applications

Coming from React or other UI frameworks, when it comes to building large applications, you might have the habit of breaking it into smaller components.

This mental model does not fit in Elm, in fact, [Component are discouraged in Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/webapps/structure.html\#components). Instead, you are encouraged to stay as long as possible in a single file. As your code grows, if they reached the point where modifying or reading is challenged enough, you can start breaking them up into smaller functions, and composing them if needed.

The chapter 6 of the [Programming Elm](https://programming-elm.com) book outlined some strategies to do so.

## Splitting the View

The view can be split into multiple functions, and you can call each function for each case.

Personally, I think each subview function can take a smaller part of the model as its arguments, so rendering is much easier to organize.

## Simplifying Messages

Messages can be grouped to reduce duplication when handling updates, using **parametrized message value**.

For example:

Let’s say you are building an Elm app for a gas station, the user can select the gas type they want: **Regulr** (87), **Mid-grade** (89), and **Premium** (91 or 93).

Initially, you would define each of the gas selections as an individual message, there will be duplication when updating the model:

```haskell
-- message
type Msg
    = SelectRegular
    | SelectMidGrade
    | SelectPremium

-- update
case msg of
    SelectRegular -> { model | gasType = Regular }
    SelectMidGrade -> { model | gasType = MidGrade }
    SelectPremium -> { model | gasType = Premium }
```

Using the parameterized message, we only need one message `SelectGas` and the gas type would be a parameter, we can reduce code duplication in the update function:

```haskell
-- message
type Msg
    = SelectGas GasType

-- update
case msg of
    SelectGas type -> { model | gasType = type }
```

## Use nested state

Organizing your application state as a flat object would make the `update` function handle too many responsibilities, making it complex to read and modify.

For example, instead of a big flat state:

```haskell
type alias Model =
    { supplyLevel: Int
    , supplyGasType: GasType
    , buyerGasLevel: Int
    , buyerGasType: GasType
    }
```

We can organize it as a nested state:

```haskell
type alias Supply =
    { level: Int
    , gasType: GasType
    }

type alias Buyer =
    { level: Int
    , gasType: GasType
    }

type alias Model =
    { supply: Supply
    , buyer: Buyer
    }
```

Using **nested state** would modularize your code better, the update function can be separated into smaller ones, each function will handle the smaller part of the state object.

For example, with the nested state, we split up the update function into
smaller functions for each type:

```haskell
updateSupply : SupplyMsg -> Supply -> Supply
updateSupply msg supply =
    case msg of
        ...

updateBuyer : BuyerMsg -> Buyer -> Buyer
updateBuyer msg buyer =
    case msg of
        ...

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        SupplyMsg supplyMsg ->
            { model
            | supply = updateSupply supplyMsg model.supply
            }
        BuyerMsg buyerMsg ->
            { model
            | buyer = updateBuyer buyerMsg model.buyer
            }
```

But nested states will make it harder to handle, especially when you have multiple levels nested. The rule of thumb is, design states sparingly when possible. When you have to use a nested state, try not to go more than one level deep.

## Use extensible records

Another alternative to nested state is **extensible records type**. It is like an interface, defined in the syntax of `type alias Something s` where `s` is the type variable. **Any record that contains all the fields defined in the extensible record, is an instance of that extensible record**.

For example, if we have a type `BlogPost`, we can create an extensible
record type `Reaction` like this:

```haskell
type alias BlogPost =
    { title: String
    , content: String
    , likes: Int
    , dislikes: Int
    }

type alias Reaction post =
    { post
    | likes: Int
    , dislikes: Int
    }
```

Any instance of `BlogPost` is also an instance of `Reaction`, because
they all have the `likes` and `dislikes` fields.

On the other hand, any record that does not have the `likes` and
`dislikes` fields are not an instance of `LikeCount`.

We can use an extensible record to split up the update function into smaller ones. For example, to implement the post’s reaction feature, we can define a new `ReactionMsg` type for the message, and write a `updateReaction` function like this:

```haskell
type ReactionMsg
    = Like
    | Dislike

updateReaction : ReactionMsg -> Reaction r -> Reaction r
updateReaction reactionMsg post =
    case reactionMsg of
        Like -> { post | likes = post.likes + 1 }
        Dislike -> { post | dislikes = post.dislikes + 1 }
```

Then, the most important part is wiring up the `ReactionMsg` and `updateReaction` into the existing `Msg` type and `update` function:

```haskell
type Msg
    = ReactionMsg ReactionMsg
    | OtherMsg OtherMsg
    | ...

type Model =
    { post: BlogPost
    }

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        ReactionMsg reactionMsg ->
            { model
            | post = ( updateReaction reactionMsg model.post )
            }
    ...
```

The `model.post` record, which has the type `BlogPost`, can be passed into the `updateReaction` function because it has `likes` and `dislikes` fields, so it’s an instance of the `Reaction` type.

By using this characteristic of extensible record, we can modularize the different features of the application easily, while being able to keep the model as a flat structure, hence, there is no need for nested structure.
